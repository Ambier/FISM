# FISM
This repository contains an implementation for the paper "FISM: Factored Item Similarity Models for Top-N Recommender Systems" by Tensorflow 1.2.
# Requirement
Python 3.5

Tensorflow 1.2
# Dataset

This data set is extracted from movielens-1m by Dr. Xiangnan He. The data set is first proposed by the paper "Neural Collaborative Filtering".

# Evaluation
I use the hit ratio(aka HR) metric to evalute the model performance. I tune the hyperparameter carefully for the best performance. Specifically,
the best performance of this code can achieve the hit ratio by 71.05%, after about 5 epoches.
